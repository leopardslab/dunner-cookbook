version: "0.1.0"

postInstallMessage: |
    This recipe takes in your current Next.js project and will run it in a standardized Node v10 environment.
    
    You can run all of the default Next scripts by executing the name of the script after `dunner do next` as follows
    
    ```
    $ dunner do next build
    ```
    
    You can also execute any custom npm script that you have specified by prepending `dunner do next-custom` as follows
    
    ```
    $ dunner do next-custom deploy:heroku
    ```

    Custom Script Syntax:
    ```
    $ dunner do next-custom INSERT_SCRIPT_NAME_HERE
    ```
